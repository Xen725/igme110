                        Overwatch is a team based first person shooter with a class system reminiscent of games such as Team Fortress 2. Despite the constant updates to the game, it has been steadily losing steam.
                        <br><br>
                        Examining strictly the user experience in Overwatch, it has been steadily declining since the release of the character Brigitte. The only major force keeping Overwatch alive in the livestreaming world is the official league, which accounts for over 50% of viewership. This is due to the average user experience, not the professionals, enjoyment declining. Unlike professionals, being in a game with other professionals, people who purposely play badly in ranked games are a huge problem for anyone without a premade team of 6 players. This is not to blame the professionals at all, but it leads to players feeling they lost before the game started, but still being forced to play it out.
                        <br><br>
                        Even if both teams are all trying their hardest, the meta has not been enjoyable since the introduction of Brigitte. For a time, the best way to win was by playing extremely slow and biding time until an impossible to counter combo using ultimate abilities could be pulled off. This lasted until the Goats meta, which called for near mindless play. This lasted for around a year, and was replaced by a meta where players do nothing be try to break shields. These metas would not be game killing on their own, but the fact that they lasted for years, and changes were far too little and too late, drove many players away from the game, including myself.
