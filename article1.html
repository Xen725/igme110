                        Super Smash Brothers Melee was originally released in 2001 on the Nintendo Gamecube. However, almost 2 decades later it remains one of the most popular competitive fighting games. The biggest reason for this longevity is the gameplay being near impossible to figure out.
                        
                        <br><br>
                        One important reason for the game never truly being figured out is the fact that it never received patches. This left players many years to explore the game in depth. Luckily, the exploits players found were not game-breaking, but instead were enhancing. Techniques like <a href= "https://www.ssbwiki.com/wavedash">wavedashing</a> and <a href = "https://www.ssbwiki.com/double_shine">multishining</a> were most likely never intended to be used in that way, but they optioned the door for so many options. Many new techniques are being found and perfected to this day, which continues to further the games lifespan.

                        Melee as a game is challenging both mentally and physically. On the physical side, professional players average around 200 actions per minute. The previously mentioned techniques are exploits of the game engine, and to do them requires incredibly precise inputs. The physical side of Melee is challenging enough. But you also need to add in the mental aspect of it. Just like any other competitive game, it requires a constant understanding of your opponent in order to beat them. Melee requires high speed both mentally and physically, and this is what makes it so challenging, and so impossible to play perfectly.
