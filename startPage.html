                                    Two words: nail, salon. It's perfect for money laundering, it's a high-volume, cash-preferred business with a discreet workforce. Nobody does mista-me-know-nothing better than Mrs. Mukjayaporn and her gals.

But uh, in this business... and Walt can back me up on this... the uh, number one rule is, don't take things personally.
